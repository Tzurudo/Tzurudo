👋 Hi, I’m @Tzurudo
I’m interested in systems modeling, programming in Python,
Java, and C++, and everything related to open source. I’m currently learning and improving my skills in software development.
💞️ I enjoy collaborating on open projects, learning with others, and sharing what I discover.
📫 You can reach me here on GitHub ⚡ Fun fact: I love penguins! 🐧.
